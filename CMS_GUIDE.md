## 💡 Best Practices for Images

* **Format**: JPG is best for photos. PNG for logos/graphics with transparency.
* **Size**: Try to keep images under 2MB. The site automatically optimizes them, but starting smaller helps upload speed.
* **Dimensions**:
  * **Cover Images**: Portrait (4:5 aspect ratio) or Landscape (16:9).
  * **Gallery Images**: Any aspect ratio works!
